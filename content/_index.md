# About Me

I am a **PhD Candidate** advised by [**Professor Julia Hockenmaier**](https://hmr-lab.github.io/) at the [**University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign**](https://illinois.edu/).

Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies at [**Duke University**](https://duke.edu/), where I majored in computer science and statistics with a minor in mathematics. At Duke, I explored applications of machine learning to hardware research under [**Professor Krishnendu Chakrabarty**](https://search.asu.edu/profile/4669916), then Chair of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

### Research

My research lies at the intersection of **Information Retrieval** and **Embodied AI**, building systems that can:

- reason about nuanced information in contextual environments, and
- operate collaboratively with other agents or humans through dialogue and action.

My doctoral work focuses on **generating semantically meaningful instructions** to enhance inter-agent and human collaboration, particularly in environments that require multimodal and spatio-temporal reasoning.

### Work

I have worked in both academic and industrial research settings.

- At [**Epsilon**](https://www.epsilon.com/), I developed large-scale similarity search and LLM-based synthetic labeling systems for personalized advertising.
- At [**Elemental Cognition**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/elementalcognition/), I extended semantic role labeling and named-entity recognition to document-level tasks, enabling real-time LLM-guided search.
- At [**IBM Research**](https://research.ibm.com), I contributed to hybrid-cloud and quantum computing projects, optimizing large-scale Optical Proximity Correction and Electronic Design Automation workflows.
- At [**Mi-Corporation**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mi-co/), I built enterprise .NET software solutions used by U.S. state agricultural departments.

### Hobbies

My main hobbies are [music production](https://soundcloud.com/404fm), exercising, and cooking.
